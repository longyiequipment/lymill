### Introduction

<p> Based on our own R&D and absorbing technology from home and abroad, we provide our clients with LYHM, which integrates the multiple crushing functions of extrusion, pulverizing, impacting. To meet our clients’ different requirements, we provide a variety of customized solutions to help them process different fineness powder. LYHM borns with some unique characteristics like high output, low unit energy consumption, long service life and convenient maintenance, which make it the perfect choice for our clients. </p>

### work principle

<p>
    LYHM crushes materials by impact, extrusion and pulverizing. When the turntable revolves round the main shaft, the grinding rollers will be stretched out to the grinding ring by centrifugal force, and press the grinding ring inner layer and rotate round the axis pin. Through the clearance between the grinding rollers and the grinding ring, the material will be crushed by the impact, extrusion and grinding of the grinding rollers. The material is ground between the first layer of the grinding rollers and grinding ring, then falls into the second layer and is ground again as per the same principle. After the material is ground by the grinding roller in the last layer, it will fall onto the turntable under gravity and brought to the interlayer between the inner and outer layers of the cylinder by negative pressure airstream, and once again rise to the air classification system for separation. Qualified powder will pass through the classifier and enter into the pulse dust collector; coarse materials will be directly knocked down to the grinding table and resettle in the pulverizing room for pulverization. The turntable is distributed in multiple layers. Thus, the material is sufficiently pulverized to reach the desired fineness.

### Application

<p>
Perfect for processing of non-metallic minerals like calcium carbonate, Kaolin, calcite, barite, talc, gypsum, limestone, calcium oxide, bentonite, dolomite and etc
</p>

### Technical Advantages

<p>
1.	To meet clients’ different requirements, fineness of powder can be easily adjusted and the quality of finished powder is stable.  
2.	In-built high-efficient classifier promises the high accuracy of classification.
3.	Patented transmission system enhances output, cuts energy cost and makes maintenance easier.
4.	All wear-resistant parts are made of high-quality alloy steel, which greatly prolongs the life span of 
5.	Fully sealed negative pressure air system boosts yield and makes production process meet national environmental requirement. 
6.	Touch-screen PLC realizes remote and centralized control, one-click operation and automatic feeding materials, which makes production efficient and stable.   
7.	LYHM production line is compact, requires limited space and cuts the construction cost. All makes it a cost-effective choice.
